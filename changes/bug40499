  o Major bugfixes (client):
    - Stop caching TCP connect failures to relays/bridges when we
      initiated the connection as a client. Now we only cache connect
      failures as a relay or bridge when we initiated them because
      of an EXTEND request. Declining to re-attempt the client-based
      connections could cause problems when we lose connectivity and
      try to reconnect. Fixes bug 40499; bugfix on 0.3.3.4-alpha.
