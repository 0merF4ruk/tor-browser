  o Minor features (dirauth):
    - Add an AuthDirVoteGuard torrc option that can allow authorities to assign
      the Guard flag to the given fingerprints/country code/IPs. This is a
      needed feature mostly for defense purposes in case a DoS hits the network
      and relay start losing the Guard flags too fast. Closes ticket 40652.
