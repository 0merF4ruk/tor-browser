  o Minor feature (onion service v2):
    - Onion service v2 address are now not recognized anymore by tor meaning a
      bad hostname is returned when attempting to pass it on a SOCKS
      connection. No more deprecation log is emitted client side. Closes
      ticket 40476.
    - See https://blog.torproject.org/v2-deprecation-timeline for details on
      how to transition from v2 to v3.
