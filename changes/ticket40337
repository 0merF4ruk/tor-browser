  o Minor features (bandwidth reporting):
    - Relays can now use the MinTimeToReportBandwidth option to change
      the smallest amount of time over which they're willing to report
      their observed maximum bandwidth.  Previously, this was fixed
      at 1 day.  For safety, values under 2 hours are only supported on
      testing networks. Part of a fix for ticket 40337.

  o Minor features (testing):
    - Relays on testing networks now report their observed bandwidths
      immediately from startup.  Previously, they waited
      until they had been running for a full day.   Closes ticket
      40337.
