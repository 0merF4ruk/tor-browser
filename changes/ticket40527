  o Major bugfixes (relay, overload):
    - Don't make Tor DNS timeout trigger an overload general state. These
      timeouts are different from DNS server timeout. They have to be seen as
      timeout related to UX and not because of a network problem. Fixes bug
      40527; bugfix on 0.4.6.1-alpha.
    - Change the MetricsPort DNS "timeout" label to be "tor_timeout" in order
      to indicate that this was a DNS timeout from tor perspective and not the
      DNS server itself.
    - Deprecate overload_dns_timeout_period_secs and
      overload_dns_timeout_scale_percent consensus parameters as well. They
      were used to assess the overload state which is no more now.
