  o Major bugfixes (bridges):
    - Make Tor work reliably again when you have multiple bridges
      configured and one or more of them are unreachable. The problem
      came because we require that we have bridge descriptors for both
      of our first two bridges (else we refuse to try to connect), but
      in some cases we would wait three hours before trying to fetch
      these missing descriptors, and/or never recover when we do try
      to fetch them. Fixes bugs 40396 and 40495; bugfix on 0.3.0.5-rc
      and 0.3.2.1-alpha.
