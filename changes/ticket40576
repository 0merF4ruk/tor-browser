  o Minor bugfixes (onion service congestion control):
    - Avoid a non-fatal assertion failure in the case where we fail to set up
      congestion control on a rendezvous circuit. This could happen naturally
      if a cache entry expired at an unexpected time. Fixes bug 40576; bugfix
      on 0.4.7.4-alpha.
